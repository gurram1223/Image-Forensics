# Image-Forensic-Challenge

The challenge comprises several original images captured from different digital cameras with various scenes either indoor or outdoor. The images are divided into images wich we call "pristine" or "never manipulated" and images we call "forged" or "fakes". The "forged" images comprise a set of different manipulation techniques such as copy/pasting and splicing with different degrees of photorealism as we describe below.

All the pristine and fake images are divided into a training and a testing set. In the training set the images will be provided along with its corresponding class and mask. In the testing set the images will be provided without any class or mask.
